Welcome to my GitHub!

I've just finished working on my degree project for my Frontend Developer studies at Medieinstitutet Stockholm (2022-2024).

Visit the [deployed site](https://ayngie.github.io/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes/) 🛸 for my degree project and check out the [repo](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) 🤓 ✨️

Happy reading and happy coding!
