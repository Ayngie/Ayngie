# Hi there 👋

✨️ Welcome to my GitHub! ✨️

I am a Front End Developer with Full Stack ambitions and a passion for health! 🙋‍♀️

I have a degree from Medieinstitutet's 'Front End Developer' education (class of 2022-2024), which included quite a bit Back End development (API's, databases, MERN-stack, etc).

### Portfolio 🤓
I recently built a new [Portfolio](https://github.com/Ayngie/react-portfolio) in React+TS+Vite+Scss, in which I introduce myself as a developer! A key focus here was a11y :)

(My [old](https://github.com/Ayngie/portfolio2.0) one is also published, it is in VanillaJS+TS and was built during first year of FE-studies).

### Degree project - A Natural Guide to Gestational Diabetes 🤰
Don't miss checking out my [Degree Project](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) - a guide to help women with Gestational Diabetes manage their blood sugar naturally! It is built in React.js+TypeScript (with Styled Components and Lazy Loading).

### Past school projects 😶‍🌫️
My public repos include a variety of old school projects - coded throughout my years at Medieinstitutet. 

### More recent projects? 🤸‍♀️
I am in the process of refactoring my degree project, creating a new portfolio, as well as building a passion project (secret for now) - stay tuned for these! 🤩

Meanwhile, I've also been playing around with tiny stuff like [health-guide](https://github.com/Ayngie/health-guide), and some other bits-n-pieces... 

Happy reading and happy coding!

Best,
✨️ Ayngie ✨️
