# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a Front End Developer with Full Stack ambitions and a passion for health!

I have a degree from Medieinstitutets 'Front End Developer' education (class of 2022-2024), which included quite a bit Back End development (API's, databases, etc).

### Past school projects
My public repos include a variety of old school projects - coded throughout my years at Medieinstitutet. 

### Portfolio
Among other projects, I created a vanilla JS +html/TypeScript/SCSS during first year of FE-studies, introducing myself as a Frontend Developer!

### Degree project - A Natural Guide to Gestational Diabetes
Don't miss checking out my degree project - a guide to help women with Gestational Diabetes manage their blood sugar naturally! 

Visit the deployed site 🛸, and feel free to share it with anyone who you think can benefit from the information! ✨️

If you're interested in seeing the code behind the site (built in React.js + Typescript, with Styled Components & lazy leading) - check it out! 🤓

### More recent projects?
I am in the process of refactoring my degree project, creating a new portfolio, as well as building a different (secret) project from scratch - stay tuned for these! 🤩

Meanwhile, I've also been playing around with tiny stuff like [health-guide](https://github.com/Ayngie/health-guide), and [bits-n-pieces](https://github.com/Ayngie/bits-n-pieces).

Happy reading and happy coding!

Best,
Ayngie
