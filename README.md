# Hi there 👋

✨️ Welcome to my GitHub! ✨️

I am a Front End Developer with Full Stack ambitions and a passion for health! 🙋‍♀️

I have a degree from Medieinstitutet's 'Front End Developer' education (class of 2022-2024), which included quite a bit Back End development (API's, databases, MERN-stack, etc).

Currently I'm furthering my back end skills at Medieistitutets System Developer .Net education (Systemutvecklare .Net, class of 2025-2027).

Feel free to contact me for job opportunities meanwhile! 

### Portfolio 🤓
I recently built a new [Portfolio](https://github.com/Ayngie/react-portfolio) in React+TS+Vite+Scss, in which I introduce myself as a developer! A key focus here was a11y :)

### Degree project - A Natural Guide to Gestational Diabetes 🤰
Don't miss checking out my [Degree Project](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) - a guide to help women with Gestational Diabetes manage their blood sugar naturally! It is built in React.js+TypeScript (with Styled Components and Lazy Loading).

### School projects 😶‍🌫️
If you follow me, you will see that my public repos will grow to include more and more school projects as I finish assignments for my current studies at Medieinsitutet.
My repositories also include a variety of old school projects - coded throughout my previous years at Medieinstitutet. 

### Other projects? 🤸‍♀️
I am in the process of building a passion project (secret for now) - stay tuned for that! 🤩

Past playfull projects include tiny stuff like [health-guide](https://github.com/Ayngie/health-guide), and some other  [bits-n-pieces](https://github.com/Ayngie/bits-n-pieces)... 

Happy reading and happy coding!

Best,

✨️ Ayngie ✨️
