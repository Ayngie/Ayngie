### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

I've just finished working on my degree project for Frontend Developer studies at Medieinstitutet Stockholm.

See my degree project [deployed](https://ayngie.github.io/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes/)🛸 and check out the [repo](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) 🤓✨️

Happy reading and happy coding!
