# Hi there 👋

✨️ Welcome to my GitHub! ✨️

I am a Software Developer with a passion for health! 🙋‍♀️ 

I have a degree from Medieinstitutet's 'Front End Developer' education (class of 2022-2024), which included quite a bit Back End development (API's, databases, MERN-stack, etc).

While furthering my back end skills at Medieistitutets System Developer .Net education (Systemutvecklare .Net, class of 2025-2027), I landed my first developer job! So now, as of October '25, I am out working with code IRL! Amazing to finally partake in this field of work! I am currently working with ASP.Net, C#, React, TypeScript and SQL 🤩

### Portfolio 🤓
Spring of 2025 I built a [Portfolio](https://github.com/Ayngie/react-portfolio) in React+TS+Vite+Scss, in which I introduce myself as a developer! A key focus here was a11y :)


### Degree project - A Natural Guide to Gestational Diabetes 🤰
Don't miss checking out my [Degree Project](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) from my FrontEnd studies - a guide to help women with Gestational Diabetes manage their blood sugar naturally! It is built in React.js+TypeScript (with Styled Components and Lazy Loading).


### School projects 😶‍🌫️
My public repos include some newer projects from my brief time at System Developer .Net education, then there are a variety of older school projects from my previous studies at Medieinstitutet. 

### Other projects? 🤸‍♀️
I have a passion project that I am developing (secret for now) - stay tuned for that! 🤩

Past playfull projects include tiny stuff like [health-guide](https://github.com/Ayngie/health-guide), and some other  [bits-n-pieces](https://github.com/Ayngie/bits-n-pieces)... 

Happy reading and happy coding!

Best,

✨️ Ayngie ✨️
