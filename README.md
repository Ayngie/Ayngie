# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

### Degree project
I've just finished working on my degree project for my Frontend Developer studies at Medieinstitutet Stockholm (2022-2024).

Visit the [deployed site](https://ayngie.github.io/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes/) 🛸 for my degree project and check out the [repo](https://github.com/Ayngie/natural-guide-to-gestational-diabetes) 🤓 ✨️

(FYI that there is an identical repo for my degree project - just with a swedish title - [here](https://github.com/Ayngie/naturlig-guide-till-graviditetsdiabetes), to help people searching for info in swedish to get better chance of finding this information).

### Past school projects
My public repos also include a variety of older school projects I have coded during my years at Medieinstitutet. Including (but not limited to :) ) a Portfolio built during first year of FE-studies, introducing myself as a frontend developer in training - view it live [here](https://ayngie.github.io/portfolio2.0/).

Happy reading and happy coding!

Ayngie
